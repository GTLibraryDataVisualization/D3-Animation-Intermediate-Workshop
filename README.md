# D3-Animation-Intermediate-Workshop


In this workshop you will learn how d3 can be used to make interactive and immersive charts through change of color, text popping up, and adding different transition effects to show how data can drive the story.

This D3 project consists of three major sections, an HTML file to create a webpage to display the visualization, a CSS file to add some styling informaiton, and a series of Javascript files to show the steps of the project. To see the changes stepwise, do link each of these Javascript files to the HTML by changing the src in the HTML file script line in the body part. The current code looks like:

		<script type="text/javascript" src="step9_transition.js"></script>
    
Change the "step9_transition.js" to other javascript files in this repository.
